     Mule runtime engine is developed using Java and many other third-party libraries. Mule apps can also contain Java libraries, particularly modules that extend Mule to provide integration functionality, such as Anypoint Connector for HTTP and the XML module. These extension modules can also contain Java (JAR) libraries.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
     The default class-loading mechanism of the JVM makes it possible to have conflicting versions of the same JAR files. In Mule, each artifact (the runtime, the Mule apps, and Mule extensions) is developed and released independently, but the JARs for these artifacts are together in the same location. For example, a Mule app might use Apache Commons Collections 2.1. If an extension you use requires Apache Commons Collections 3.1, the app might not work as expected because Commons Collections 2.1 and Commons Collections 3.1 have conflicting resources.

       Mule 3 Solution

      <div class="paragraph">
       <p>
        To solve the problem of clashes between different apps, Mule 3 relied on hierarchical organization of class loaders. Though Mule apps can see their extensions, the libraries bundled within them, and their runtime libraries, Mule apps cannot access other app libraries.
       </p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
       <p>
        Other potential conflicts remained in Mule 3, such as clashes between libraries from different extensions, clashes between extension and app libraries, and clashes between app and runtime libraries.

   API Definition
  </h2>
  <div class="sectionbody">
   <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
     Mule runtime engine and the artifacts (apps, domains, policies, and extensions) need to have a clear API definition that specifies a contract for each artifact and limits the exposure of the artifact content to other artifacts.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
     A clear API for each artifact provides a way to limit the scope of classes and libraries, which in turn makes it possible to create class loaders that do not share everything.

      Mule 3 exposes all the classes that are bundled within its libraries. This exposure caused problems when upgrading from one Mule version to another because changes in the runtime could potentially affect any of your custom Java classes.

   Adding Dependencies to Connectors
  </h2>
  <div class="sectionbody">
   <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
     When the connectors in your application need access to a dependency in your project, configure the dependency to be visible by the connector’s class loader. There are two different ways to do this:
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="ulist">
    <ul>
     <li>
      <p>
       Configure application dependencies as

       .

       <a href="#additional-plugin-dependencies">

     Shared Libraries
    </h3>
    <div class="paragraph">
     <p>
      All dependencies (JAR files, for example) declared in the application’s
      <code>
       pom.xml
      </code>
      file are visible to the application’s class loader but not visible to the class loader of each connector used in the application. The Mule runtime engine class-loading mechanism isolates each connector to prevent it from accessing classes from other connectors. If a connector’s class loader needs access to an application dependency, declare this dependency as a shared library.
     </p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
     <p>
      Consider an application that uses Anypoint Connector for Java, and the connector needs to use a class that is part of a JAR dependency declared in the application’s
      <code>
       pom.xml
      </code>
      file. However, this is not possible, because the connector’s class loader is not able to find that class. To make this class visible to the connector, you must declare the dependency that contains the class as a shared library in the Mule Maven plugin configuration of your application’s
      <code>
       pom.xml
      </code>
      file.
     </p>

    <div class="paragraph">

      If you use Anypoint Studio to configure a connector that uses external libraries, the dependencies are automatically added as shared libraries. For example, if you add Anypoint Connector for Database to your application and then configure the connection driver using Anypoint Studio, the driver is automatically added as a shared library in your project’s

     <p>
      Instead of configuring shared libraries to make application dependencies visible to all connectors in the application, you can configure additional plugin dependencies to enrich a specific connector’s classpath. This configuration enables you to effectively add new dependencies to a connector, as if the dependencies were declared in the connector’s
      <code>
