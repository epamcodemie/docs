     Mule applications collect
     <em>
      business event

     information (such as transaction execution time, errors, success or failure results, and message payload information) about flows and message processors that handle your

       Events map to message processors and connectors and are the low-level details of a transaction. Events are not supported in batch processing.

   Business Event Types
  </h2>

   <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
     You can track two types of business events:
     <em>
      default events
     </em>
     and
     <em>
      custom events
     </em>
     .
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
     Default event tracking is supported by all connectors and selected message processors. Enabling default events for these elements enables you to perform advanced debugging at runtime. You can enable default event tracking at either the flow level or the message processor level.
     <br/>
     See
     <a class="xref page" href="business-events-in-components">
      Configure Default Events Tracking
     </a>
     for configuration details.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
     Custom event tracking is supported by the Custom Business Event component. Custom events are always tracked, enabling you to monitor high-level activities in your flow that are relevant to your business.

   Monitoring Business Events
  </h2>

    <p>
     You can enable Insight in Runtime Manager to monitor business events at runtime. These events can help you analyze the root cause of failures, isolate performance bottlenecks, and test for compliance with company procedures.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
     Certain default events are tracked automatically after you enable Insight, but you must enable others in your application before they are tracked.

   Best Practices for Business Events
  </h2>
  <div class="sectionbody">
   <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
     Consider the following recommended practices when configuring business events tracking:
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="ulist">
    <ul>
     <li>
      <p>
       Enable default events only for processes that have particular value to you. To filter out unnecessary information, determine which stages within a business transaction you need to track, and enable tracking for only those stages.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       Use custom events to track key process indicators: for example, "Total Order Amount" or "Tracking Number" to surface the high-level business activities in your flow.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       Customize the transaction ID so that meaningful information, such as an order number, an employee identification number, or a shipment tracking number, is displayed for a transaction.
       <br/>
       This practice makes analysis and debugging easier and more intuitive at runtime.
