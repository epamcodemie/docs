     Planned or unplanned, infrastructure and application downtime can come at any time, from any direction, and in any form. The ability to keep an organization operational during a technology outage, facility destruction, loss of personnel, or loss of critical third party services is critical to preventing irreversible damage to a business. With the increasing global shift to e-commerce models and their reliance on 24/7 application uptime, high availability (HA) and disaster recovery (DR)  impact the financial health of organizations.

   High Availability Versus Disaster Recovery
  </h2>
  <div class="sectionbody">
   <div class="ulist">
    <ul>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        High availability (HA)
       </strong>
       - The measure of a system’s ability to remain accessible in the event of a system component failure. Generally, HA is implemented by building in multiple levels of fault tolerance and/or load balancing capabilities into a system.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Disaster recovery (DR)
       </strong>
       - The process by which a system is restored to a previous acceptable state, after a natural (flooding, tornadoes, earthquakes, fires, etc.) or man-made (power failures, server failures, misconfigurations, etc.) disaster.
      </p>
     </li>
    </ul>
   </div>
   <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
     While they both increase overall availability, the notable difference is that with HA there is generally no loss of service. HA retains the service and DR retains the data, but with DR, there is usually a slight loss of service while the DR plan executes and the system restores.

   Deploying Mule for HA and DR Strategies
  </h2>
  <div class="sectionbody">
   <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
     You can deploy the Mule Runtime in many different topologies to address your HA and DR strategies. One method is through the use of clustering, which is described later in this document. Mule High Availability Clustering provides basic failover capability for Mule.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
     When the primary Mule Runtime becomes unavailable, for example, because of a fatal JVM or hardware failure or it’s taken offline for maintenance, a backup Mule Runtime immediately becomes the primary node and resumes processing where the failed instance left off.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
     After a system administrator recovers a failed Mule Runtime server and puts it back online, that server automatically becomes the backup node.

   <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
     Seamless failover is made possible by a distributed memory store that shares all transient state information among clustered Mule Runtimes, such as:

     As you build your Mule application, it is important to think critically about how best to architect your application to achieve the desired availability, fault tolerance, and performance characteristics.

   Creating Effective SLAs
  </h2>
  <div class="sectionbody">
   <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
     The Service Level Agreement (SLA) outlines the specific definition of what is acceptable.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
     The basic definition of high availability is that the service is up and
functioning, that is, properly processing requests and responses. This does not
mean the service always operates at full capacity. Systems designed with high availability protect against interruptions and prevent outages from happening in the first place. The SLA identifies expectations for all stakeholders.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
     SLA Requirements:
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="ulist">
    <ul>
     <li>
      <p>
       Single points of failure are eliminated
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       Traffic/requests are redirected/handled

     <li>
      <p>
       Detection of failures
      </p>
     </li>
    </ul>
   </div>
   <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
     For example a basic service may have the following SLA:
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="ulist">
    <ul>
     <li>
      <p>
       The normal operation of the service handles 1000 transactions per sec with 1 sec response times.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       The total downtime per year will be 0.5% or 1.83 days.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       Minimal acceptable service impact level is 100 transactions per sec with 1 sec response times for a period of 2 hours a week.

      It is plausible that two nodes in a clustered or load balanced environment can support 1,500 TPS with one-second responses. In this state, the normal operation of the SLA is being met. If a node fails, the service is impacted. However, the impact does not breach the SLA because the node is able to handle 700 TPS with one-second responses; well above the agreed upon acceptable impact level.

      The basic definition of fault tolerance is a failure within the system does not impact the service at all. This differs from high availability as service impact and downtime is tolerated.

      Fault tolerance differs from high availability by providing additional resources that allow an application to continue functioning after a component failure without interruption. Fault tolerant environments are more costly than high available environments.

      The goal is to be able to quickly make changes to the environment without impacting the SLAs; including upgrading infrastructure and the applications running on the infrastructure. Typically zero downtime deployments leverage a side-by-side deployment, where the old and new coexist for a short period of time. This is in contrast to an in-place deployment where the service may experience reduced capacity to complete downtime.

      The baseline production environment is the current operating environment. A new environment is created with the changes (upgraded runtimes, configurations, new applications, etc).  A small percentage of traffic flows to the new environment and increases as the confidence in the new environment increases. The baseline production environment continues its use until the new environment is fully operational (it is handling 100% of the traffic). Once the new environment is accepting all traffic, it becomes the new baseline production environment and the previous baseline production environment terminates.

     Disaster recovery (DR) is the process by which a system is restored to a previous acceptable state, after a natural or man-made disaster. It is important that the selection of the appropriate DR strategy be driven by business requirements. For DR, use measurable characteristics, such as Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO), to drive your DR plan.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
     Disaster recovery is about your Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and your Recovery Time Objective (RTO). RPO is the "point" that you return to after an IT disaster. For example, if you back up every 24 hours, your RPO is a maximum of 24 hours ago. RTO, on the other hand, is how quickly you can restore to your RPO and get back to business. This includes activities like the time it takes to get your spare equipment to start running your backups if your primary equipment isn’t working.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
     System backups are a major component of a solid disaster recovery program. There are three types of recovery: cold, warm, and hot.

   Keep Integrations Stateless
  </h2>
  <div class="sectionbody">
   <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
     As a general design principle it is always important to ensure the integrations are stateless in nature. This means that no transactional information is shared between various client invocations or the executions (in case of scheduled services). If some data has to be maintained by the middleware due to a system limitation, it should be persisted in an external store such as a database or a messaging queue and not within the middleware infrastructure or memory. It is critical to note that as we scale, especially in the cloud, the state and resources used by each worker/node should be independent of the other worker. This model ensures better performance, scalability as well as reliability.
