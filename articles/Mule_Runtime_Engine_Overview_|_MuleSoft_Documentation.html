     Mule runtime engine (Mule) is a lightweight integration engine that runs Mule
applications and supports domains and policies. Mule applications, domains,
and policies share an XML DSL (domain-specific language).

   Mule Applications
  </h2>
  <div class="sectionbody">
   <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
     Mule applications connect systems, services, APIs, and devices using API-led
connectivity instead of point-to-point integrations. Mule applications provide
functionality for message routing, data mapping, orchestration, reliability,
security, and scalability.

   Mule Domains
  </h2>
  <div class="sectionbody">
   <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
     Domains enable you to share global configurations that Mule applications need to
reuse, such as default error handlers, shared properties, scheduler pools, and
component configurations. You can only deploy domains when running Mule runtime engine on premises.

   Policies
  </h2>
  <div class="sectionbody">
   <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
     Policies on HTTP-based APIs can enforce security, regulate traffic through
Mule applications, and adapt APIs to your business needs.

   </div>
   <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
     Mule includes an embedded API Gateway, which enables you to apply
security policies to an API, enrich incoming or outgoing messages, and add
capabilities to an API without having to write any code.

   Maven Support

   <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
     Maven is a project management utility that Mule implements to enhance project
development. Mule provides built-in Maven functionality. For the Mule runtime engine,
you can integrate the packaging, testing, and deployment of your Mule applications,
domains, and custom policies with your Maven lifecycle using the Mule Maven plugin.

   Mule Installation, Deployment, and Management

  <div class="sectionbody">
   <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
     For a Mule app to run, it must be deployed to an environment where the Mule
runtime engine is installed.

     Mule is packaged within the

     IDE and with
     <a class="xref page" href="../../design-center/">

       Runtime Fabric

      <div class="paragraph">
       <p>
        Runtime Fabric is a container service that enables you to run Mule applications and API gateways within a data center or third-party cloud environment that you control and manage. You can install Runtime Fabric on a set of physical servers, virtual machines, or within Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.
       </p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
       <p>
        Runtime Fabric comes bundled with technology such as Docker and Kubernetes, which offer benefits such as high availability, failover, clustering, and load balancing. See

        Runtime Fabric can be managed only by Cloud control planes (US cloud, EU cloud). MuleSoft Government Cloud and Anypoint Platform PCE do not support Runtime Fabric.

       Hybrid Standalone Runtimes
      </p>
      <div class="paragraph">
       <p>
        Hybrid standalone runtimes enable you to host the Mule runtime engine in an environment you control. This model provides the control and security of deployments within customer trust boundary combined with the flexibility, scalability, and centralized management of cloud-based services.
       </p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
       <p>
        With hybrid standalone runtimes, the Mule runtime engine can run on a physical server, a virtual machine, or within a third-party cloud service like Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Microsoft Azure.

       Standalone Runtimes
      </p>
      <div class="paragraph">
       <p>
        Standalone runtimes are useful for isolated environments where connecting to the internet or Anypoint Control Plane isn’t feasible. These environments enable you to host Mule runtime engine on a single instance, such as a physical server, virtual machine, or within a third-party cloud service like AWS or Azure. This setup offers simplicity and control, but it requires that you manually manage infrastructure tasks like high availability, failover, clustering, and load balancing. No connection to Anypoint Control Plane is required, and you manage these Mule instances entirely within your own environment.
       </p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
       <p>
        You can manage standalone runtimes by using cloud control planes (US Cloud, EU Cloud, MuleSoft Government Cloud) or a customer-hosted control plane (Anypoint Platform PCE).

      </div>
     </li>

     In addition to using Runtime Manager, you can perform deployments and manage
Mule apps with
