  Understanding HTTP Connection Handling during Mule Runtime Shutdown
 </h1>
 <div id="preamble">

    <p>
     Mule runtime engine (Mule) manages HTTP connections during shutdown through a two-stage graceful shutdown process followed by a forceful termination.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
     This process first refuses new connections while allowing existing ones to complete with a
     <code>
      Connection: close
     </code>
     signal, then rejects new requests entirely while finishing in-flight processing, before finally forcefully terminating all remaining connections upon timeout.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
     This supports seamless scale-down scenarios, enabling the reduction of Mule replicas while maintaining the stability and reliability of the application by progressively draining traffic.

       Mule State: Mule started and is running normally.

     Phase 2: HTTP Graceful Shutdown - Mule Stopping

      <p>
       Duration: Up to the configured HTTP Graceful Timeout (default: 5 seconds). However, if all existing HTTP connections are closed before this timeout period elapses, the HTTP Graceful Shutdown phase will end early, and Mule won’t wait for the full timeout duration.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       Mule State: Mule is initiating a shutdown or transitioning to stopped.

       HTTP Behavior:

      <div class="ulist">
       <ul>
        <li>
         <p>
          No new connections: The HTTP server stops accepting new incoming TCP connections (the acceptor socket is closed).
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          Existing and In-Flight requests: Ongoing HTTP requests (both those already being processed  in-flight and those on existing, established connections) will continue to be handled normally. However, all responses will include the
          <code>
           Connection: close
          </code>
          header, signaling to the HTTP client to close the connection after the current request-response cycle.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          Early termination: If there are no active HTTP connections when the stop signal is received, the HTTP Graceful Shutdown phase will end immediately, even before the timeout period expires.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          Late-Arriving requests: If an HTTP request arrives just before the HTTP Graceful Timeout is reached, it’ll still be processed normally, even if the processing extends beyond the HTTP Graceful Shutdown timeout.

   Configure Shutdown Timeout
  </h2>
  <div class="sectionbody">
   <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
     Note that while the HTTP Graceful Shutdown Timeout and the overall Mule Graceful Shutdown Timeout serve distinct purposes in the shutdown sequence, you configure them using the same
     <code>
      shutdownTimeout
     </code>
     parameter within the
     <code>
      &lt;configuration&gt;
     </code>
     element of your Mule application’s XML file.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
     Specify the value in milliseconds (default 5000 milliseconds), which controls the maximum duration for both graceful shutdown periods. For example:
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="listingblock">
    <div class="content">
     <pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-xml hljs" data-lang="xml">&lt;mule ...&gt;
  &lt;configuration shutdownTimeout="10000" /&gt; &lt;/mule&gt;</code></pre>
