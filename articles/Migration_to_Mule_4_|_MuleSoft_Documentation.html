  Migration to Mule 4
 </h1>
 <div class="paragraph">
  <p>
   For your Mule 3 apps to take advantage of Mule 4, migrate them to Mule 4 through one of the following processes:
  </p>
 </div>
 <div class="ulist">
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     A fully manual migration of connectors, modules, transports, expressions, and API gateways to their Mule 4 counterparts.
    </p>
    <div class="paragraph">
     <p>
      For guidance with a fully manual migration, see

      .
     </p>
    </div>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     A partially automated migration with the Mule Migration Assistant (MMA), which is available as an open source project on GitHub.
    </p>
    <div class="paragraph">

      For guidance using MMA to assist in a migration, see the

      . MuleSoft suggests that you try MMA to determine whether you prefer it to a fully manual migration. Note that you can run MMA on a sample application by following steps in the

   A benefit of using MMA is that it automates part of the migration of Mule 3 apps to Mule 4. Though the MMA does not migrate the app entirely, it provides significant help with the following tasks:
  </p>
 </div>
 <div class="ulist">
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     Migrating the project structure.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Automatically creating descriptor files, such as
     <code>
      pom.xml
     </code>
     or
     <code>
      mule-artifact.json
     </code>
     .
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Automatically performing many adaptations of the appâ€™s code.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Providing guidance on how to manually migrate components and patterns that cannot be migrated automatically.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </div>
 <div class="paragraph">
  <p>
   MMA helps with such tasks, but it does not deliver a fully functional app. Some additional steps are required. Those steps include testing and can also include:
  </p>
 </div>
 <div class="ulist">
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     Manual migration of unsupported components.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Manual migration of complex MEL expressions to DataWeave that cannot be automatically converted by MMA.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Manual migration of complex DataWeave transformations that cannot be automatically converted by MMA.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Prior migration of the DataMapper with the DataWeave Migration tool, before running the MMA.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </div>
 <div class="paragraph">
  <p>
   It is also important to note that the MMA does not support incremental migrations.
