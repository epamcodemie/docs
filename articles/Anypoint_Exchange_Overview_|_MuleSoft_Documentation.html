     Anypoint Exchange is a curated catalog of reusable assets. APIs, API groups, API spec fragments, custom assets, examples, GraphQL APIs, integration assets such as connectors, policies, RPA assets, rulesets, and templates are some of the types that are supported in Exchange. See
     <a class="xref page" href="asset-types">
      Asset Types
     </a>
     for more information about each type of asset. You can catalog (publish), share, discover, learn about, and reuse assets within your organization of developers to facilitate collaboration, boost productivity, and promote standards.

     Use Exchange to discover, share, incorporate assets and resources into your applications, and view asset usage and engagement metrics. You can create API developer portals, view and test APIs, simulate sending data to APIs by using the mocking service, create assets, and use API Notebooks to describe and test API functions.
    </p>

    <p>
     Exchange assets are accessible from many places, such as Anypoint Studio (connectors, templates, and examples), API Manager (APIs, API groups, and policies), or Runtime Manager (applications). APIs can be published from Design Center to Exchange.

     Assets in the
     <strong>
      Provided by MuleSoft

     organization are created by MuleSoft and its partners and certified by MuleSoft. These assets are publicly available to all customers. However, assets that are created by an organization other than
     <strong>
      Provided by MuleSoft
     </strong>
     and published in that organization’s instance of Exchange are private and not visible outside that organization. Customers are responsible for any private assets they publish within their Exchange instance.
