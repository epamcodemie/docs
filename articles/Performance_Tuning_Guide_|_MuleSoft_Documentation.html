     To achieve optimal performance from your Mule applications, you must evaluate both the applications themselves and the environment in which they run. Although Mule 4 is designed to tune itself, your applications might exhibit performance issues due to their initial construction or dependencies.

     Similarly, for on-premises installations, you might need to tune the environment itself so that your Mule applications can take full advantage of it. Because many variables influence it, tuning the performance of your application requires some trial and error.

     You can simplify performance tuning by using documented best practices and testing your applications in ideal test environments.  The following recommendations come from the Development and Services Engineering teams and benchmarking efforts by MuleSoft Performance Engineering.
