   Conceptually, you can think of Mule 4 as an evolution of Mule 3. Many of the core concepts are the same: applications, flows, connectors, DataWeave, and so on. However, because it is simpler, there is less to learn and less for you to manage.

      Connectors
     </a>
     <br/>
     The approach to connectivity was unified in Mule 4. Mule 3 transports were replaced with new operation-oriented connectors that are easier to use, have better out-of-the-box defaults, and provide new advanced capabilities.
