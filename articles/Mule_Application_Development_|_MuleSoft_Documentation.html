     You create Mule applications to perform system integrations. Typically, the
application reads data from internal and external sources, processes and
transforms data to the required formats or structures, and writes that
output to the systems and servers where you store or use the transformed data.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
     Mule applications are configured to run in Mule runtime engine (Mule). A request
to a Mule application triggers Mule to encode the request and data in a Mule
event and to pass it to either single or multiple threads.

     DataWeave is the primary language used for formulating expressions in Mule.
Connectors, modules, and components support the use of DataWeave to access,
manipulate, and transform data structures and output formats, and to extract data
that is processed within the Mule application.

   Mule Flows
  </h2>
  <div class="sectionbody">
   <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
     Understanding basic flow architecture is key to understanding a Mule application.
Essentially, every Mule flow contains a series of Mule components that receive or
process messages:

    <div class="content">
     <img alt="A flow including an HTTP Listener, data transformation, database connection, and logging process" src="_images/flow-example.png"/>

    </div>
   </div>
   <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
     At the simplest level, flows are sequences of processors. A message
that enters a flow can pass through a variety of processors. In a typical
flow, a Mule application receives a message through a source (such as an
HTTP Listener component), transforms that message into a new format, and processes
any business logic before writing the processed message to an external
system in a format that the system can read.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
     To separate processing into more manageable units, Mule applications often contain
multiple, interrelated flows instead of just a single flow. One flow can call
another flow as a direct reference.

     Sources
    </h3>
    <div class="paragraph">
     <p>
      A source component (or trigger) is the first component in a flow. It
receives a triggering event, creates a corresponding Mule event,
and forwards that event for processing by the next component in the flow.
     </p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
     <p>
      External clients can trigger processing in a Mule flow through several
communication protocols and methods, such as JMS, HTTP, FTP, JDBC, or File.
Mule translates these communication protocols and methods into a standard
message format, which passes through the flowâ€™s processors.
     </p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
     <p>
      Sources in Mule can connect to specific external sources, either through
a standard protocol or a third-party API. It is also possible to set a Scheduler
component. Some schedulers can poll for specific changes to external resources,
such as new files or table rows in an external resource. Examples of listeners
and connector operations that can trigger a flow include:
     </p>

    <div class="ulist">
     <ul>
      <li>
       <p>
        HTTP, JMS, and VM listeners in their associated connectors

     Processors
    </h3>
    <div class="paragraph">
     <p>
      After a flow is triggered through the source component, subsequent components process
the data as it travels through the flow. By default, each processor
that receives a Mule event returns a new Mule message, typically with a set
of attributes and the message payload that the processor returns. The processor
forwards the new message as output to the next processor in the flow.
     </p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
     <p>
      Processors available to Mule applications include:

     <ul>
      <li>
       <p>
        Components from modules and connectors
       </p>
       <div class="paragraph">
        <p>
         Examples include operations that read
from and write to an external resource and that validate data in the Mule application.
Some operations can make client requests to external resources and services
(including external databases and systems, such as Salesforce, Workday,
ServiceNow, and many others) and to other Mule applications. Others can run your
custom code, support OAuth configurations, and manage communication through
asynchronous queues, for example. Many other operations are
available.

       <p>
        Core components
       </p>
       <div class="paragraph">
        <p>
         Core components can route data, perform data transformations, handle errors
that might occur when processing the event, and perform other tasks in a
Mule application.
        </p>
       </div>
       <div class="paragraph">
        <p>
         Transformers (such as the Transform Message, Set Variable, and others) are
key to exchanging data between nodes. Transformers enable Mule to convert
message data in the Mule event to a format that another application or service can
read.
        </p>
       </div>
       <div class="paragraph">
        <p>
         Mule also enables content enrichment of messages (through
         <a class="xref page" href="target-variables">
          Target Variables
         </a>
         ) so that you can retrieve
additional data and attach it to the message.

     You can develop a Mule application using
     <a class="xref page" href="../../studio/latest/">
      Anypoint Studio
     </a>
     (an Eclipse-based IDE), or, if you are an advanced developer, in your own IDE.

   </div>
   <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
     For example, in Studio, you build and design a Mule application in a project
that contains one or more XML-based files. A Mule project supports all the
dependencies required for development. The
     <a class="xref page" href="../../studio/latest/#package-explorer">
      Package Explorer

provides access to the project folders and files that make up a Mule project.

your Mule application.

     The Mule version you use determines what your Mule application, domain, or policy can
do and what features and products are compatible with Mule.  For example,
     <a class="xref page" href="about-components">
      Core components
     </a>
     , which process the Mule event
as it travels through flows in a Mule application, are part of a Core module that is
bundled with and shares the same version as Mule.
     <a class="xref page" href="../../connectors/">
      Modules, connectors
     </a>
     , the DataWeave language, and
several MuleSoft products have their own versioning system but are
compatible with specific versions of Mule. For example, DataWeave 2.0 and
Studio 7.x are compatible Mule 4.x runtime engines, while DataWeave 1.0 and
Studio 6.x are compatible with Mule 3.x runtime engines. You need to make sure the
connector or module you use in a Mule application is compatible with your Mule version.
