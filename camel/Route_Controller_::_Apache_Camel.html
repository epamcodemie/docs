     Camel uses a
     <code>
      RouteController
     </code>
     for managing the lifecycle of all the routes. The controller is mainly in use during starting up the routes when Camel startup.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
     The controller is handling which routes, and in which order they should be started.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
     Camel offers two kinds of controllers. The classic default controller, and a supervising controller that can attempt to restart routes that failed during startup.

   DefaultRouteController
  </h2>
  <div class="sectionbody">
   <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
     This is the default controller and strategy that has always been in use by Camel. The controller works with the
     <em>
      fail fast
     </em>
     principle, that if any routes fail to start, then it gives up and Camel itself fails to start up.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
     The controller also starts the routes sequentially and uses a single thread. This means there is no concurrent startup, meaning the routes are started more reliably without concurrency issues.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
     If a route fails on startup then it is often its
     <code>
      Consumer
     </code>
     that triggers an error in its startup. Some components offer a way to handle this internally and attempt to recover from this. However, most components do not offer such a feature and therefore in most situations, the route would fail to startup and therefore also Camel itself. The JMS component is an example of a component that can recover from startup issues in the
     <code>
      Consumer
     </code>
     such as failing to connect to the JMS broker.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
     The
     <code>
      SupervisingRouteController
     </code>
     is capable of handling this, and manages routes that have failed to startup, by taking over and attempting to restart these routes.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
     Given the routes below:
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="listingblock">
    <div class="content">
     <pre class="highlightjs highlight"><code class="language-java hljs" data-lang="java">from("file:foo/cake")
  to("log:cake");

from("salesforce:cheese")
  to("log:cheese");</code></pre>
    </div>
   </div>
   <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
     Then the two routes may fail on startup. However, the first route with the file component would very likely always start up as it is just using the file system that is reliable.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
     The second route, however, is using Salesforce, which can fail to start up if there is no network connecting to Salesforce.

     A supervising capable
     <code>
      RouteController

     that delays the startup of the routes after the camel context startup and takes control of starting the routes in a safe manner. This controller is able to retry starting failing routes, and has various options to configure settings for backoff between restarting routes.

      When using supervising route controller, then all routes would by default be supervised and allow Camel to start up successfully; even if one or more routes failed to start up.
