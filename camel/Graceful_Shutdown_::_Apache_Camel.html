     Camel supports a pluggable shutdown strategy using

     <a class="xref page" href="camelcontext.html">

      If a graceful shutdown could not shutdown cleanly within the given timeout period, then Camel performs a more aggressive shutdown by forcing routes and thread pools etc to shut down. When the timeout happens, then Camel logs information about the current inflight exchanges, which shows from which route the exchange origins, and where it currently is being routed. For example the logging below, shows that there is 1 inflight exchange, that origins from route1, and currently is still in route1 at the "delay1" node. The elapsed is time in millis how long at the current node (eg delay1) and duration is total time in mills.

      <code>
       Defer
